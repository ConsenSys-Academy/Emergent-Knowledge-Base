### Filling out a template can help ensure two things.

-   **_First_**, it helps in understanding the nature of the problem you're asking about. Sometimes doing so can help us solve our own problems.

-   **_Second_**, it provides the valuable context mentioned above. This increases the chances of finding an answer as it reduces the amount of time & effort needed to grasp the basics of the situation. It also provides an asynchronous way of someone else understanding your problem so they can still try to help, even if you're unavailable.
