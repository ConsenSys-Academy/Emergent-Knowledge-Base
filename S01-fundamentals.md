### Question:
How does an Ethereum wallet "register" the PrivateKey it generated with the network? Say I generated a long random string per Ethereum Private Key standards, how does that then work with the Ethereum network? Like how does the network know that that string is associated with Ethereum Accounts?

### Answer: 
From my understanding, there is no registration needed. The ledger is just recording transactions between addresses. You could send a transaction to any possible address, regardless if someone has the private key for it or not.
