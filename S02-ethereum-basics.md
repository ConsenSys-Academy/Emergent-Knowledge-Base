### Question
After reading the section on EIP-1559, I've a question about the priority fee -- i was wondering if this is still makes transactions susceptible to MEV, i.e., front-running
### Answer
It doesn't change anything MEV wise. Miners can still order the transactions as they see fit and can front-run. Their algorithms would probably determine the cost benefit of both.
If the juice is worth the squeeze, and they can squeeze, they will do it.
